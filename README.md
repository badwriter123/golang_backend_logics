<h2>Hello --> All of Golang backend questions for interview prep , and solutions available in this repo.</h2>
<h2>Some important Golang pointers 
  <br>
<h4>1. In GOLANG classes are not used. Instead packages are used.
  <br>
  2. There is no concept of OOPS,. like in java.
<br>
3. Each Go file must belong to some package. And it should start with the keyword package followed by the package name.
<br>
4. Every executable Go file must have main package. It is like a default package to execute Golang code.</h4>

<h3>Questions and Solutions will be pushed Daily.</h3>
<h4>1. Feb 14 2026 -> Initial commit to this repo with basic Hello World file</h4>
<h4>2. Feb 15 2026 -> Sample Golang server present in server1.go -> server folder. Contains an HTML form to do basic addition and how it runs is handled by server1.go, /math-form/ route. Will drop simple code next time. Will start with the basic.</h4>
